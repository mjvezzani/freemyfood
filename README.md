The "Free My Food" project serves to provide the public with resources that
will inform them about the state of food production and agriculture in
America, and how economics and politics heavily influence why kinds of foods
are made available to Americans, despite what their nutritional content is
and what impact they have on an individual's health.

The site is broken up into five parts.

********* Home Page *********

This will be a constantly updated page that provides the latest articles on
the politics & economics that are influencing food production and supply in
America.

There will be a dynamic sidebar that pulls in information in real time. In the
center, boxes will designate individual articles that have a title, time, author,
and picture associated with each one.

********* About Page *********

This page will explain who I am, what the purpose of the site is, and a little
about my history with agriculture, agrarianism, etc.

********* Blog Page *********

A place for me to insert my own ideas and opinions into the general discourse
that will be created by the other content on my website.

********* Causes Page *********

This will provide site visitors with access to resources that are similar in
topic with my own website. This could include other informative websites, food
services (i.e. foodshares and community farming projects), and links to the
political movements influencing our American food supply.

********* Contact Page *********

This will provide site visitors with a way to communicate with me through a
simple message system that will route messages to a domain associated email
system.
